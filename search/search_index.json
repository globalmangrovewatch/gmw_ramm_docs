The optical image alert system is limited by cloud cover, often delaying the detection of mangrove loss and diminishing its impact for mangrove conservation. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) penetrates cloud cover and offers potential to provide consistent monthly alerts. However, in coastal regions analytical methods must address the complex interaction of the SAR signal with mangrove canopy and water.</p> <p>The consortium combines the expertise, experience, and leadership positions of three organizations \u2013 an environmental EO application development company (Hatfield), champion user (DGES/GMW), and early adopter (Wetlands International):   - Hatfield provides deep project management expertise, experience in remote sensing and mangrove assessment and monitoring, cloud platform exploitation, and engagement with the user community including IFIs.   - DGES is the technical lead for GMW and provides deep scientific and technical expertise in remote sensing, mangrove assessment and monitoring, and computer science with a demonstrated publication and user community engagement track record.   - Wetlands International is a global leader in mangrove conservation and restoration and coordinating member of the GMA, with expertise in specification and dissemination of remote sensing products and advocacy on policy.</p> <p>RAMM is implemented over the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) baseline extent (currently 2020) in a two stage per pixel approach, designed to maximize efficiency.  The first stage is a simple rule-based approach based on thresholding of backscatter value and difference from the previous year\u2019s median backscatter value, which reduces effects of seasonal and tidal variability and radar speckle.  The thresholds are designed to minimize false negatives (i.e. capture all possible mangrove loss). The second stage is a 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) that is trained on a dataset of confirmed alerts and false positives (both produced by GMW). The integration of false positives into the training dataset encourages the model to recognise and flag falsely identified alerts provided by the rule-based first stage as deep learning algorithms are known to extract fine-grained patterns between domain distributions. </p> <ul> <li>Andrew Dean - Hatfield Consultants</li> <li>Benjamin Smith - Hatfield Consultants</li> <li>Pete Bunting - Aberystwyth University</li> <li>Dr. Victor Tang - Hatfield Consultants</li> <li>Lammert Hildarides - Wetlands International</li> <li>Frank Martin Seifert - European Space Agency (ESA)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#platform","title":"Platform","text":"<p>With an Open Call with the European Space Agency (ESA), funding was provided to develop the RAMM platform on CREODIAS.

Running the pipeline at the end of each month, the pipeline iterates through the following stages:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Change Detection: The first stage is to detect change    in the SAR data. This is done by gathering the previous    months acquisitions over the provided target area.    The acquisitions are stacked and potential mangrove loss pixels are    identified using a tuned threshold.    The potential mangrove loss pixels pixels are then compared     to the same month of the     previous year's median composite and classifying as possible    alerts if the absolute difference is greater than a threshold.    Outputs are then written to BLOB Storage. </p> </li> <li> <p>Mangrove Alert Validation: The second stage pulls the      first stage outputs from BLOB Storage and     uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to validate     that each alert is a mangrove deforestation event.     The validated alerts are then written to BLOB Storage      as a GeoJSON file that can be ingested by the GMW Portal.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The first stage thresholds are tuned by performing a sensitivity analysis across real-world data.
