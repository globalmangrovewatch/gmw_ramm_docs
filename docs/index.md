# RAMM

RAMM is a dynamic, event-driven, pipeline that leverages
Sentinel-1 Sythnetic Aperature Radar (SAR) information to
complement the existing and running optical satellite
pipeline by Global Mangfove Watch (GMW).
Optical satellite imagery has been able to provide timely
alerting for mangrove deforestation alerting, however, it
has a drawback when the monitored area is cloud covered.
SAR has the ability to penetrate clouds and detect these
possible missed events.
